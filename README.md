# üìäüìàüîç Google Play Store EDA

The **Google Play Store** is one of the largest platforms for Android applications, offering millions of apps across categories like **Games**, **Productivity**, **Health**, and more. It serves as the primary distribution channel for Android developers to **publish**, **promote**, and **monetize** their applications to a global audience.

This dataset provides detailed information about a wide range of apps available on the store. Each row represents a unique app and includes attributes such as:

- App name  
- Category  
- Rating  
- Number of reviews  
- Size, installs, type, price  
- Last updated version, Android compatibility  
...and more.

The data was originally scraped from the Google Play Store. Without access to this platform and the efforts involved in compiling it, such analysis would not be possible.
